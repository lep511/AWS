# Amazon CloudFront distributions example

## Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) with Amazon CloudFront to
list and update distributions.

*CloudFront speeds up distribution of static and dynamic web content by
delivering it through a worldwide network of edge locations that provide low 
latency and high performance.* 

## Code examples

* [Listing CloudFront distributions](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/python/example_code/cloudfront/list_distributions.py) 
(`list_distributions`)
* [Updating a CloudFront distribution](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/python/example_code/cloudfront/update_distribution.py) 
(`get_distribution_config`, `update_distribution`)

## âš  Important

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
