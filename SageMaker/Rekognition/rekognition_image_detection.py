Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) with Amazon Rekognition to
recognize people, objects, and text in images.

The usage demo in this file uses images in the .media folder. If you run this code
without cloning the GitHub repository, you must first download the image files from
    https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/python/example_code/rekognition/.media
