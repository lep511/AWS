    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Translate is constantly learning and evolving to provide the “perfect” output. In domain sensitive applications such as legal, medical, construction, engineering, etc., customers can always improve the translation quality by using custom terminology (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-translate-custom-terminology/). This is a great approach for most of the cases but there are some outliers which might require light post-editing by human teams. The post-editing process helps businesses to understand the needs of their customers better by capturing the nuances of local language that can be lost in translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such businesses and organizations who want to augment the output of Amazon Translate (and other Amazon AI services), Amazon Augmented AI (https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/) (A2I) provides a managed approach to build human driven post-editing workflows. Amazon A2I brings human review to all developers, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building human review systems or managing large numbers of human reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how you can use **Amazon Augmented A2I and Amazon Translate to create a human review workflow which allows your private workforce to effectively review, correct and tag the documents translated by Amazon Translate, at scale**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate A2I in your Amazon Translate Workflows, you will the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An **S3 Bucket** to store the files that you need to translate and process the output generated from the Human Review Workflow after the Human Loop has completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A **Worker Team** to review and improve the translations done using Amazon Translate. To learn more about Private Worker Teams, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-workforce-private.html\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A **Worker Task Template** to create a worker UI. The worker UI displays your input data, such as documents or images, and instructions to workers. It also provides interactive tools that the worker uses to complete your tasks. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-instructions-overview.html\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A **Human Review Workflow**, also referred to as a flow definition. You use the flow definition to configure your human workforce and provide information about how to accomplish the human review task. You can create a flow definition in the Amazon Augmented AI console or with Amazon A2I APIs. To learn more about both of these options, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-create-flow-definition.html\n",
    "    \n",
    "When using a custom task type, as this tutorial will show, you start a human loop using the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API. When you call `start_human_loop()` in your custom application, a task is sent to human reviewers."
