    "# Improving speech-to-text transcripts from Amazon Transcribe using custom vocabularies and Amazon Augmented AI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook accompanies the blog [Improving speech-to-text transcripts from Amazon Transcribe using custom vocabularies and Amazon Augmented AI](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improving-speech-to-text-transcripts-from-amazon-transcribe-using-custom-vocabularies-and-amazon-augmented-ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "When transcribing speech containing domain-specific terminologies in fields such as legal, financial, construction, higher education, or engineering, [Amazon Transcribe’s](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/) [custom vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-vocabulary.html) feature can improve transcription quality, especially on key technical terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use custom vocabularies with Amazon Transcribe, you need a list of domain-specific terms. Using a collection of videos or audio files (i.e., your dataset) that you want transcribed with high accuracy, you can send a portion of your dataset to Amazon Transcribe to identify terms it has difficulty with, indicated by low-confidence scores. You can use [Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)](https://aws.amazon.com/a2i/) to send these low-confidence predictions directly to a human to manually review and transcribe the terms. This walkthrough will demonstrate how you can process the results obtained from Amazon A2I to quickly to build a custom vocabulary, at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, in this walkthrough you will:\n",
    "* Send a subset of videos to Amazon Transcribe to find terms that are difficult to transcribe.\n",
    "* Set up a human review workflow using Amazon A2I to send low-confidence predictions to your human workforce for manual review and transcription.\n",
    "* Create a custom vocabulary using the results obtained from human workers.\n",
    "* Test Amazon Transcribe on another subset of videos to assess the improvement in transcription quality. \n",

    "![mistranscription_before](https://aws-ml-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts/a2i-transcribe-custom-demo/images/mistranscription_custom_before.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example of mis-transcribed annotation of the technical term, “an EC2 instance”. This term was transcribed as “Annecy two instance”.*\n",
    "\n",
    "![mistranscription_after](https://aws-ml-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts/a2i-transcribe-custom-demo/images/mistranscription_custom_after.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example of correctly transcribed annotation of the technical term “an EC2 instance” after using Amazon A2I to build an Amazon Transcribe custom vocabulary and re-transcribing the video.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough focuses on transcribing video content. You can modify the code provided to use audio files (such as MP3 files) by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Upload audio files to your [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) bucket and using them in place of the video files provided.\n",
    "* Modify the button text and instructions in the worker task template provided in this walkthrough and tell workers to listen to and transcribe audio clips.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram presents the solution architecture:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you can simply execute each cell in order. Before beginning, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An AWS account.\n",
    "* An S3 bucket you can write to - please provide its name in `BUCKET`. The bucket must be in the same region as this SageMaker Notebook instance. All the video files involved in this demo will be stored in `s3://BUCKET/a2i_transcribe_demo`. All A2I results will be stored in `s3://BUCKET/a2i-results/`. All Amazon Trasncribe results will be stored in `s3://BUCKET/transcribe-results/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this use case, the following are also recommended:\n",
    "1. Basic understanding of AWS services [Amazon Transcribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is-transcribe.html) and Transcribe [custom vocabularies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-vocabulary.html), and the core components and workflow used by [Amazon A2I](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-use-augmented-ai-a2i-human-review-loops.html). The notebook uses the [AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) to interact with these services.  \n",
    "2. Familiarity with Python and numpy.\n",
    "3. Basic familiarity with [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been tested on a SageMaker notebook instance. The runtimes given are approximated on an ml.t2.medium instance. You can run it on a local instance by first executing the cell below on SageMaker and then copying the name of the role to your local copy of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more sample notebooks using A2I, visit this [Github repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-a2i-sample-jupyter-notebooks).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this post, we walked through an example of how you can improve transcripts from Amazon Transcribe using custom vocabularies and an Amazon A2I human review workflow. This allows you to quickly identify domain-specific terms using your own private workforce and review workflows, and use these terms to build a custom vocabulary so that future mentions of term are transcribed with greater accuracy, at scale. Transcribing key technical terms correctly can be important for doing SEO, enabling highly specific textual queries, and grouping large quantities of video or audio files by important technical terms.\n",
