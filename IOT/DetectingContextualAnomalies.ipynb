    "Detecting anomalies in data from IoT devices and processes is key to identifying instrumentation faults, failing devices, operational procedure errors and problematic noisy data that requires preprocessing to remove outliers. One of the challenges with IoT data is understanding what data constitutes an anomaly. There are obvious anomalies, such as when a temperature sensor reboots and registers first its maximum and then a 0 temperature before returning to normal data measurement. However, anomalies that are within the normal operating range of the system, but are outside of the normal operating range when compared to the surrounding measurements, are more difficult to discover.  These are called 'contextual' anomalies and are the target of this Notebook's time series anomaly detection.     \n",

    "Although anomaly detection is a broad field, time series, particularly streaming time series, is a special case because the baseline for what constitutes normal data is constantly evolving. To handle this case, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) method was originally designed for signal processing. For IoT data, where physical processes tend to produce particularly noisy data, EWMA is, unfortunately, sensitive to abrupt changes in data trends. For this reason, we'll use a probabilistic approach to EWMA, or PEWMA. This is a modification of the exponentially weighted moving average in which outlier data points are dampened so that they influence the moving average less. \n",

However, this requires storing intermediate state somewhere (for example in DynamoDB) which may introduce lags to data processing. For an example of how to implement PEWMA in AWS Lambda see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/anomaly-detection-using-aws-iot-and-aws-lambda/\">this blog</a>.\n",

    "In our Notebook, we will be looking for contextual anomalies in sample wind speed data from wind measurement equipment located throughout San Francisco. Contextual anomalies, as mentioned before, are data points which are within the normal range of data but, because of the context of surrounding data, are out of the ordinary.  An example of a contextual anomaly is a wind speed measurement that suddenly jumps from 30 to 70m/s. The 70m/s measurement may not be unusual in itself, but it is unusual in the context of previous measurements which were much lower. "
