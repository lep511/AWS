    Shows you how to use the &Python3long; to create a web application that
    lets you do the following:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Upload photos to an &S3long; (&S3;) bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Use &REKlong; to analyze and label the photos.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Use &SESlong; (&SES;) to send email reports of image analysis.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
    This example contains two main components: a webpage written in JavaScript that is
    built with React, and a REST service written in Python that is built with
    Flask-RESTful.
    </para>

    <para>You can use the React webpage to:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Display a list of images that are stored in your S3 bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Upload images from your computer to your S3 bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Display images and labels that identify items that are detected in the image.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Get a report of all images in your S3 bucket and send an email of the report.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The webpage calls the REST service. The service sends requests to
        &AWS; to perform the following actions:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Get and filter the list of images in your S3 bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Upload photos to your S3 bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Use &REK; to analyze individual photos and get a list of labels that
             identify items that are detected in the photo.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Analyze all photos in your S3 bucket and use &SES; to email a report.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
