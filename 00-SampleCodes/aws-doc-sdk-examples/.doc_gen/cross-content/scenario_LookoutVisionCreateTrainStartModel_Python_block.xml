        Creates and optionally starts an &LYRAlong; model using command line arguments.
        The example code creates a new project, training dataset, optional test dataset,

        try your model with an image.

        This example requires a set of images to train its model. You can find example
        circuit board images on GitHub that you can use for training and testing.
        For details on how to copy these images to an &S3long; (&S3;) bucket, see
