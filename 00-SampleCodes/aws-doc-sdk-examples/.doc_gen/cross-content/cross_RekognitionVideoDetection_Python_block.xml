        Use &REKlong; to detect faces, objects, and people in videos by starting
        asynchronous detection jobs. This example also configures &REK; to notify
        an &SNSlong; (&SNS;) topic when jobs complete and subscribes an
        &SQSlong; (&SQS;) queue to the topic. When the queue receives a
        message about a job, the job is retrieved and the results are output.
