# Amazon Comprehend detection, classification, and topic modeling examples

## Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) with Amazon Comprehend to inspect
documents and discover information about them.

* Detect elements of a document, such as languages used, key phrases, and personally
identifiable information (PII).
* Train a custom classifier that learns a set of labels on GitHub issues, and send 
new issues to the classifer for labeling.
* Detect common themes in a set of documents without the need for prior annotation.

*Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about 
the content of documents without the need of any special preprocessing.*

## âš  Important

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

### Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
  Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- Python 3.8.5 or later
- Boto3 1.15.4 or later
- Requests 2.24.0 or later
- PyTest 6.0.2 or later (to run unit tests)

### Command

There are three demonstrations in this set of examples:

* Detecting elements in a single document.
* Training and running a custom classifier to label GitHub issues.
* Detecting common themes in a set of documents.

**Element detection**

Run this example at a command prompt with the following command.

```
python comprehend_detect.py
``` 

**Custom GitHub issue classifier**

Run this example at a command prompt with the following command.

```
python comprehend_classifier_demo.py
``` 

**Document themes**

Run this example at a command prompt with the following command.

```
python comprehend_topic_modeler_demo.py
``` 

### Example structure

The examples contain the following files.

**comprehend_classifier.py**

Shows how to use the Amazon Comprehend custom classifier APIs to create, train, and 
manage a custom classifier, and use it to run classification jobs.  

**comprehend_classifier_demo.py**

Shows how to use Amazon Comprehend to train a custom multi-label classifier and run a 
job to classify documents.

* Trains a classifier on a set of GitHub issues with known labels.
* Sends a second set of GitHub issues to the classifier so they can be labeled.
* Reconciles classifier labels with existing issue labels.  

**comprehend_demo_resources.py**

Creates, manages, and deletes AWS resources used by the Amazon Comprehend
demonstrations.

* Creates an Amazon S3 bucket that contains training, input, and output data.
* Creates an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and policy that grants
permission to let Comprehend read from and write to the Amazon S3 bucket.
* Gets output data from Amazon S3 and extracts it from its compressed format into
usable Python objects.
* Cleans up the Amazon S3 bucket and IAM role and policy.   

**comprehend_detect.py**

Shows how to use Amazon Comprehend to detect entities, phrases, and more in a document.
The `usage_demo` function sends the `detect_sample.txt` contents to Comprehend to 
demonstrate the API.

**comprehend_topic_modeler.py**

Shows how to use Amazon Comprehend to run topic modeling jobs.

**comprehend_topic_modeler_demo.py**

Show how to use Amazon Comprehend to run a topic modeling job on sample data
retrieved from a public Amazon S3 bucket. The demonstration sends the data to 
Comprehend for topic modeling, waits for the job to complete, and extracts the 
resulting output into a list of Python dictionaries.

**detect_sample.txt**

Sample text that is used by the detection demonstration.

## Running the tests

The unit tests in this module use the botocore Stubber. This captures requests before 
they are sent to AWS, and returns a mocked response. To run all of the tests, 
run the following command in your [GitHub root]/python/example_code/comprehend 
folder.

```    
python -m pytest
```
