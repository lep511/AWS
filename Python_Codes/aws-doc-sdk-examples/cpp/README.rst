AWS SDK for C++ Code Examples
#############################

A collection of code examples for the AWS SDK for C++. The examples are grouped
according to the AWS service they demonstrate.

Prerequisites
=============

Before using the Code Examples, first complete the installation and setup steps of `Getting Started  
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html>`_ in the AWS SDK for C++
Developer Guide.

The Getting Started section covers how to obtain and build the SDK, and how to build your own
code utilizing the SDK with a sample “Hello World”-style application.  A similar procedure is 
applicable to utilizing the code examples in this repository.

Building and running the code examples
=============
 
Additional information geared specifically to understanding the example applications is at
`AWS SDK for C++ Code Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/programming-services.html>`_.

Additional information
=============

- As an AWS best practice, grant all code least privilege, or only the permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see `Grant Least Privilege
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege>`_ in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are available only in specific Regions. For more information, see `Region
  Table <https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/>`_ on the AWS website.

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

- To propose a new code example for the AWS documentation team to consider producing, create a
  new request. The team is looking to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use 
  cases, versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls. For instructions, see
  the “Proposing new code examples” section in the 
  `Readme on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
