# Amazon CloudWatch code examples in C#

## Purpose

This folder contains examples that show how to use the AWS SDK for .NET 3.x to
get started working with CloudWatch features such as alarms and
dashboards.

Amazon CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs,
metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources,
applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers. You can use
CloudWatch to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms,
visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot
issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.

## Code examples

- [DeleteAlarmsExample](DeleteAlarmsExample/) - Delete an existing CloudWatch alarm.
- [DescribeAlarmHistoriesExample](DescribeAlarmHistoriesExample/) - Retrieve information about existing CloudWatch alarms.
- [DisableAlarmActionsExample](DisableAlarmActionsExample/) - Disable actions for a specific CloudWatch alarm.
- [EnableAlarmActionsExample](EnableAlarmActionsExample/) - Enable actions for a specific CloudWatch alarm.
- [GetDashboardExample](GetDashboardExample/) - Get information for a CloudWatch dashboard.
- [ListDashboardsExample](ListDashboardsExample/) - List the dashboards created for an AWS Account.
- [ListMetricsExample](ListMetricsExample/) - List existing CloudWatch metrics defined for an AWS Account.

## âš  Important
- We recommend that you grant your code least privilege, or at most the minimum
  permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide. 
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are
  available only in specific [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the examples

The examples in this folder use the default user account. The call to
initialize the Amazon CloudWatch client does not specify the AWS Region. Supply
the AWS Region to match your own as a parameter to the client constructor. For
example:

```
IAmazonCloudWatch cwClient = new AmazonCloudWatchClient(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USWest2);
```

### Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
  Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- .NET Core 5.0 or later
- AWS SDK for .NET 3.0 or later
- XUnit and Moq (to run unit tests)

Once the example has been compiled, you can run it from the command line by
first navigating to the folder that contains the .csproj file, and then
issuing the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

Or you can execute the example from within your IDE.

individual API calls.
