        Use &CMPlong; to train a custom multi-label classifier and run a job to
        classify documents. The demo trains a classifier on a set of GitHub issues
        with known labels. After the classifier is trained, the demo sends a second
        set of GitHub issues to the classifier so they can be labeled.
